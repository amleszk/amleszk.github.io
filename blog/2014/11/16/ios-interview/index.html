	<div class="entry-content"><h1>Stages</h1>

<h3>Initial phone call</h3>

<p>This is done with the technical recruiter, I would actually opt to have this phone call last close to 45 minutes and ask 3-4 probing questions, which ideally would allow the candidate to be able to show their major acheivements in previous projects.</p>

<p>If the recruiter can take notes during this call, and pass on those notes to the Tech screener so they can probe even deeper on the phone screen stage</p>

<h3>Tech screen</h3>

<h3>Onsite</h3>

<p>The trend is to have a full day schedule for engineering interviews, which includes a lunch (my record is 10 people in one day). I often wonder why so many people are needed in this process. My personal preference is a half-day, with 4-5 interviews lasting ~4 hours.</p>

<h1>Facets of the interview</h1>

<h2>&lsquo;Explain&rsquo; questions</h2>

<p>The objective here is to get a sense of how well the candidate can articulate, and absorb knowledge. These can also easily be done over the phone.</p>

<ul>
<li>Explain autolayout</li>
<li>Explain ARC</li>
<li>Explain UI responder chain</li>
<li>Explain NSNotification center</li>
<li>Explain your process of debugging</li>
<li>Explain how you get re-usability out of Interface builder</li>
<li>Explain tradeoffs of Inteface builder over layout in-code</li>
</ul>


<h2>Objective C language</h2>

<ul>
<li>What is a Category, when would you use it? when would we use inheritance instead?</li>
<li>Explain when you would use NSOperation versus Grand central dispatch</li>
<li>Explain the <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code></li>
<li>How does <code>UIAppearance</code> proxy work?</li>
<li>Explain what a block is</li>
<li>What are some common memory management pitfalls?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Terminology/process</h2>

<ul>
<li>What is a <code>hack</code>, when are they typically used?</li>
<li>Can you give some benefits of having a release cycle?</li>
<li>What are some key steps involved in AppStore submission?</li>
<li>What are some ways we monitor iOS apps in production?</li>
<li>What do we gain from using UIKit versus another UI library?</li>
<li>What are some common ways to test apps? which are most beneficial do you think?</li>
</ul>


<h2>UIKit</h2>

<ul>
<li>Explain the lifecycle of a <code>UIViewController</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Take home test</h2>

<p>Many companies give a take home test, which is a task to write an iOS app that fulfills a few basic features with some extra credit tasks. The spec of a takehome test is often a mundane toy app that hits an API and displays some results.</p>

<p>As a candidate, we end up using the same <code>UITableView</code>/<code>UICollectionView</code> design patterns that don&rsquo;t allow any learnings&hellip; I would encourage the takehome tests to be a little more open on what is acceptable to submit. And ask the candidate to give a summary of what they did/why in the submission also.</p>

<h2>Whiteboard Design</h2>

<p>Easy (10-20min), Design the code interface for :</p>

<ul>
<li>an application that controls group of Elevators</li>
<li>a Chess game</li>
<li>Some other well known board game (Connect 4, Go, Checkers..)</li>
</ul>


<p>Harder (20-30min):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Explain how you would add a Theme to a <code>UIViewController</code>. The theme needs to be defined on a server, and updated on the client.</p>

<ul>
<li>How would the user make changes to that theme?</li>
<li>How would the changes get saved?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You are building a local business discovery app such as Yelp, and you had a <code>Give rating</code> component which allows the user to rate a business on a star rating. The companent needs to display any ratings and update ratings with the API. Can you draw the class diagram and methods you would use</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Criteria:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Explaining the full stack of an iOS app (API,model,view,controller) and the separation of concerns</li>
<li>Can a solution be formulated and discussed fluidly</li>
<li>Is their ability to whiteboard the solution</li>
<li>Does the candidate use MVC and network programming</li>
</ul>


<h2>Code tasks</h2>

<p>I would definately allow the candidate to do these tasks on their laptop, whiteboard coding is <strong>so awkward</strong> for the candidate, mainly because mistakes can&rsquo;t be corrected easily.</p>

<p>Give a sample XCode project (use a USB stick to save the Wifi hassles) which runs some unit tests that fail initally, but pass on correct implementation. Maybe even ask the candidate to add some tests.</p>

<p>Like the whiteboard design question, a well known board game can be a nice starting point. How would you design algorithms for</p>

<ul>
<li>Valid moves on a chess board</li>
<li>Detecting a win in Connect4</li>
<li>Detecting valid checkers moves</li>
</ul>


<p>Also a small problem involving UIKit could work too.</p>

<h2>&lsquo;Ask me questions&rsquo;</h2>

<p>I had one interview with a manager where the only thing he asked was <code>What questions do you have for me?</code>. For half an hour we discussed only things I bought up. He gave pretty short answers to each, maybe 5 minutes per question. This is actually great for guaging the candidate&rsquo;s interest and what they value in a role and org culture.</p>

<p>Also the candidate will be getting a lot of pressure in other interviews, this can be a relaxing intermission.</p>
