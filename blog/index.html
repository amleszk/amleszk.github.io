		<h1>Stages</h1>

<h3>Initial phone call</h3>

<p>This is done with the technical recruiter, I would actually opt to have this phone call last close to 45 minutes and ask 3-4 probing questions, which ideally would allow the candidate to be able to show their major acheivements in previous projects.</p>

<p>If the recruiter can take notes during this call, and pass on those notes to the Tech screener so they can probe even deeper on the phone screen stage</p>

<h3>Tech screen</h3>

<h3>Onsite</h3>

<p>The trend is to have a full day schedule for engineering interviews, which includes a lunch (my record is 10 people in one day). I often wonder why so many people are needed in this process. My personal preference is a half-day, with 4-5 interviews lasting ~4 hours.</p>

<h1>Facets of the interview</h1>

<h2>&lsquo;Explain&rsquo; questions</h2>

<p>The objective here is to get a sense of how well the candidate can articulate, and absorb knowledge. These can also easily be done over the phone.</p>

<ul>
<li>Explain autolayout</li>
<li>Explain ARC</li>
<li>Explain UI responder chain</li>
<li>Explain NSNotification center</li>
<li>Explain your process of debugging</li>
<li>Explain how you get re-usability out of Interface builder</li>
<li>Explain tradeoffs of Inteface builder over layout in-code</li>
</ul>


<h2>Objective C language</h2>

<ul>
<li>What is a Category, when would you use it? when would we use inheritance instead?</li>
<li>Explain when you would use NSOperation versus Grand central dispatch</li>
<li>Explain the <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code></li>
<li>How does <code>UIAppearance</code> proxy work?</li>
<li>Explain what a block is</li>
<li>What are some common memory management pitfalls?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Terminology/process</h2>

<ul>
<li>What is a <code>hack</code>, when are they typically used?</li>
<li>Can you give some benefits of having a release cycle?</li>
<li>What are some key steps involved in AppStore submission?</li>
<li>What are some ways we monitor iOS apps in production?</li>
<li>What do we gain from using UIKit versus another UI library?</li>
<li>What are some common ways to test apps? which are most beneficial do you think?</li>
</ul>


<h2>UIKit</h2>

<ul>
<li>Explain the lifecycle of a <code>UIViewController</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Take home test</h2>

<p>Many companies give a take home test, which is a task to write an iOS app that fulfills a few basic features with some extra credit tasks. The spec of a takehome test is often a mundane toy app that hits an API and displays some results.</p>

<p>As a candidate, we end up using the same <code>UITableView</code>/<code>UICollectionView</code> design patterns that don&rsquo;t allow any learnings&hellip; I would encourage the takehome tests to be a little more open on what is acceptable to submit. And ask the candidate to give a summary of what they did/why in the submission also.</p>

<h2>Whiteboard Design</h2>

<p>Easy (10-20min), Design the code interface for :</p>

<ul>
<li>an application that controls group of Elevators</li>
<li>a Chess game</li>
<li>Some other well known board game (Connect 4, Go, Checkers..)</li>
</ul>


<p>Harder (20-30min):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Explain how you would add a Theme to a <code>UIViewController</code>. The theme needs to be defined on a server, and updated on the client.</p>

<ul>
<li>How would the user make changes to that theme?</li>
<li>How would the changes get saved?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You are building a local business discovery app such as Yelp, and you had a <code>Give rating</code> component which allows the user to rate a business on a star rating. The companent needs to display any ratings and update ratings with the API. Can you draw the class diagram and methods you would use</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Criteria:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Explaining the full stack of an iOS app (API,model,view,controller) and the separation of concerns</li>
<li>Can a solution be formulated and discussed fluidly</li>
<li>Is their ability to whiteboard the solution</li>
<li>Does the candidate use MVC and network programming</li>
</ul>


<h2>Code tasks</h2>

<p>I would definately allow the candidate to do these tasks on their laptop, whiteboard coding is <strong>so awkward</strong> for the candidate, mainly because mistakes can&rsquo;t be corrected easily.</p>

<p>Give a sample XCode project (use a USB stick to save the Wifi hassles) which runs some unit tests that fail initally, but pass on correct implementation. Maybe even ask the candidate to add some tests.</p>

<p>Like the whiteboard design question, a well known board game can be a nice starting point. How would you design algorithms for</p>

<ul>
<li>Valid moves on a chess board</li>
<li>Detecting a win in Connect4</li>
<li>Detecting valid checkers moves</li>
</ul>


<p>Also a small problem involving UIKit could work too.</p>

<h2>&lsquo;Ask me questions&rsquo;</h2>

<p>I had one interview with a manager where the only thing he asked was <code>What questions do you have for me?</code>. For half an hour we discussed only things I bought up. He gave pretty short answers to each, maybe 5 minutes per question. This is actually great for guaging the candidate&rsquo;s interest and what they value in a role and org culture.</p>

<p>Also the candidate will be getting a lot of pressure in other interviews, this can be a relaxing intermission.</p>

		<p>This the first &lsquo;Mobile forum&rsquo; event I&rsquo;ve seen in New york. Invite only and held at the facebook office at Astor place. The format was based around small groups brainstorming and open discussion, then group facilitators would present key points to all attendees.</p>

<p>here are the top take aways I had:</p>

<h4>You should try out <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> for internal communications</h4>

<p>I heard Slack recommended throughout discussion. Especially its search functions. I actually haven&rsquo;t had the chance to use it, but am now very keen.</p>

<h4>Train web developers into native</h4>

<p>Mobile teams need more developers than the market can handle, and web is becoming a secondary platform to native. Etsy spoke about having dedicated roles for training into the native space. Identify developers who are keen to make the transition and give them full support.</p>

<h4>Build a testing culture, but tread lightly</h4>

<p>The tools are still in infacy to support native TDD, and they probably will never get to a level when testing can be fully embraced. Culture spawned from the web world (where testing is simpler) have transitoned and can adversely impact delivery if taken at full speed.</p>

<h4>Modularise code bases into libraries</h4>

<p>Modular code is a given, but splitting your app into libraries takes an extra level of foresight. The tools are not great, and you will incur overhead costs, but some time in the future you will need to draw a line in the sand and split your architecture out.</p>

<h4>Force yourself to have 1-on-1&rsquo;s</h4>

<p>Giving and receiving feedback is not natural, but without it teams and the individuals will have trouble growing. The 1-on-1 gives a unique opportunity to get a certain level of honesty. It keeps you accountable and gets feelings out in the open. Especially important in remote teams, but I would recommend regular 1-on-1&rsquo;s in all dev teams.</p>

<h4>Pull based API schemas</h4>

<p>Facebook&rsquo;s mobile app pulls lots of data, and with large teams and large data needs they experienced <em>overfetching</em> (too much data coming back, makes managing responses sluggish) and <em>underfetching</em> (where the API data does not match the needs of the client so additional round trips are needed). As far as I understood it, A pull based API means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have only 1 endpoint</li>
<li>The client specifies an entity schema and gets back a token. e.g:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>POST /api/schema_register
</span><span class='line'>{newsfeed{date,title,author{friends}},messages,...}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>The token is then stored on the client, and used to request the exact data it needs for all future requests</li>
<li>The API never deletes fields, or has relaxed deprecation</li>
<li>The API only sends back what is requested. This addresses over/under fetching problems</li>
<li>A GET request may look like:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /api/data?schema_token=1234
</span><span class='line'>RESPONSE:
</span><span class='line'>{ "newsfeed" : { "date" : "1414960696", "title" : "foo" ...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At Meetup this problem existed as well. We were requesting additional fields all the time. Scaling the schema identifiers may cause problems but overall i like this approach</p>

<h3>The format</h3>

<p>Really liked the peer-to-peer discussions. I was having conversations about identical problems others had faced and insights into their unique solutions. I&rsquo;d like to see some more controversial, &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; topics next time. And maybe splitting platform specific discussions to their respective audience (I was not too interested in Android JVM issues presentation).</p>

		<p>I have a mixed reaction to code questions, when not used carefully they have the ability to taint the interview process. In a regular setting no one writes code under the time contraints and stress levels that are present in technical interviews. But it makes sense to ask a candidate, who is interviewing for a programming position, to actually write some code and produce a solution to a problem. The issue is with the overly complex questions, if you ask the candidate a bad code question it can be very off-putting.</p>

<p>Code questions are a fact of tech interviewing,  so I am going to do some analysis of a few to determine if they are good questions to ask</p>

<p>A quote from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4LExVkv4Pw">Kellan Elliott-McCrea</a>: Fundamentally, interviews ask the question: &ldquo;Quick, prove to me how smart you are&rdquo; &ndash; smart is not optional, quick and prove to me are very rarely part of the job.</p>

<h2>Case 1: Algorithm design</h2>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Given 2 words, write a function that determines if the words are anagrams of eachother</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never seen this question before, I think the answer can be difficult to visualize, and a candidate who is under pressure may struggle. How the question is presented makes a surprising amount of difference, what is the essence of an anagram? It&rsquo;s a word in the english language, a string of characters that &ndash; when rearranged &ndash; corresponds to another word.</p>

<p>So the same question re-worded:</p>

<p><strong>Real Question:</strong> Given 2 strings, write a function that determines if all characters are in both strings.</p>

<h3>Some answers from stackoverflow:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15045791/782808">Sort both words by characters and string compare</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15045892/782808">Map each letter to a hash, keep counts, compare counts</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17004897/782808">Map each letter to a prime number and sum the results</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The most common answer would be to iterate through the first string, searching for characters in the second string, while keeping track of duplicates. Sorting both strings is a shortcut to this process.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<p>Rewording the question to reduce cruft should be your first step. The strings being anagrams is <strong>completely irrelevant</strong>. You are being asked to find the intersection of 2 sets of characters. The interviewer did not pose the question this way because ability to reduce cruft is what is being tested.</p>

<h2>Case 2: Code design</h2>

<p>An alternative to writing an algorithm is the code design question. Take the following example:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Elevators have a relatively simple control mechanism, the user calls an elevator using a button <code>UP</code> or <code>DOWN</code>. Design an elevator control system using object oriented paradigms.</p>

<p>The objective of this is to talk about an MVC approach to designing. A good answer should model <code>Elevator</code> class with getters/setters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-(int) currentFloor</code></li>
<li><code>-(int) destinationFloor</code></li>
<li><code>-(void) setDestinationFloor:(NSInteger)destinationFloor</code></li>
</ul>


<p>and <code>Button</code> class:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-(int) floor</code></li>
<li><code>-(Direction) callDirection</code></li>
<li><code>-(void) setCallDirection:(NSInteger)callDirection</code>

<ul>
<li><code>-(void) clearCall</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>and <code>ElevatorController</code> class:</p></li>
</ul>


<p><code>public</code></p>

<ul>
<li><code>-(Elevator *) callAvailableElevatorFromFloor:(NSInteger)floor direction:(Direction)direction</code></li>
</ul>


<p><code>private</code></p>

<ul>
<li><code>@property NSArray *calledButtons</code> &ndash; Of type <code>Button</code></li>
<li><code>@property NSArray *elevators</code> &ndash; Of type <code>Elevator</code></li>
</ul>


<p>some followup questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Describe the process of calling an elevator and getting to the destination floor</li>
<li>How would you handle a button call of <code>UP</code> and <code>DOWN</code> from the same floor?</li>
</ul>


<p>This has more of a natural feel to it than the algorithm question, it&rsquo;s is a problem programmers would actually face regularly. Athough this question feels easy initially, we could extend the idea to a chess game, or a 4 player card game.</p>
